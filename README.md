Capital Greenspace Project UoE 21-22 

The accompanying HTML file is a copy of the code created for the University of Edinburgh 2021-22 MSc GIS & EO Capital Greenspace Project. My groups focus was on what the value of greenspaces in Edinburgh as carbon sinks in relation to a locations Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) score. The HTML code also has embedded a Python GeoJSON script for an interactive map on the website.

The aims of the research were:
•	To understand the spatial pattern of high value carbon greenspaces in Edinburgh, determine data zones which are both too far (1km) from high value greenspaces and are deprived (SIMD below 20% percentile)
•	To determine which greenspaces can be afforested to improve environmental deprivation. 

These aims were achieved with the following methodology:
1) The area and number of trees in each greenspace was calculated; 
2) The carbon stock of each tree was calculated; 
3) The carbon concentration (kg/m2) per greenspace was calculated. The greenspaces carbon value was then classified from high to low, and the SIMD bottom 20% percentile identified, in order to determine a 1km threshold from the high value carbon greenspaces and the bottom 20% percentile data zones.


The website’s primary audience was the Edinburgh City Council and Central Scotland Green Network, for them to easily access the findings of the data analysis that are relevant to the potential policy implications that Edinburgh City Council would be able to undertake using this research. It briefly explains the background and methods for the research before guiding the user to the interactive map on the Findings page as well as to the potential afforestation sites outlined in the Policy Considerations page. The Home page also provides background information for the researchers involved and links to their LinkedIn pages for further contact information.
